## Strong Util

This is a public set of utility classes.
Use it to get the hazzle out of Date and String operations.

*  **DT** is a shortname for Date and Time
*  **Str** is a shortname for String

### Sample code

	if (Str.isEmpty(name)) { ... }
	Date niceDay = DT.date(2011,12,24);
	int age = DT.years( DT.date(1958,12,14), new Date() );

Note that DT uses months from 1 to 12 (not 0 to 11).

Check out the javadoc to see what more is available.
Send an email if you want more functions added.
We will add whatever we find useful as general 
utility-features in our projects - and make the
code available online.
