Strong Util
===============================

This is a public set of utility classes.
> import no.strong.util
Then you may use simple tests like:
> Str.isEmpty(s)
as a shorthand for __s==null || s.trim().length()==0__

This package also contains some Date utilites like:
> Date niceDay = DT.date(2011,12,24);
Use this if you hate to months from 0 to 11 ;-)

Check out the javadoc to see what more is available.
